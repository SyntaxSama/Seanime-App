# Seanime
Seanime is an anime streaming & manga platform this app is not an official application by seanime, this is made for android users to enjoy seanime on their phone this application requires termux, you have been warned!

# How To Use/Install
1) Install termux from the app store.
2) Download the apk installer from the releases page, go through the installation steps run the scan etc.
3) Open the seanime app that you just installed
4) Follow the setup instructions that you are prompted to do on the screen
5) When you're done all the steps head back and tap on "I've Done This"
6) You are now done setting up seanime to work on your phone!

Just a fair notice, you will be thrown entirely into full screen mode when using the application. Seanime is NOT bundled into the app at all this app is simply an android server loader so you dont need to open the website link every single time.
auto updates are non existent on this app so its recommended to check this if an update is on here, you will know by being in the seanime discord you can always ping and ask me my handle on discord is the same as my github profile handle.

# DISCLAIMER!
If you have any issues with this app, for whatever reason do NOT ping or ask the creator of seanime for support, this is NOT an official app there for rendering this as useless to ask him for help. Reach out to the creator of this app on discord in his server (Issue a ping!)

I've tested this app fully out, and i can confidently tell you full screen watching for anime has not worked for me, i dont know if its because the library might have not been updated properly or if its using a very old version. This i cannot control so do NOT ask me or the creator of seanime for help this is solely relying on the person who created the seanime termux package.

I have no control over when the termux package is updated etc, I would highly assume it is up to date with the latest version.
